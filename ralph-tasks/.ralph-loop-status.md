# Ralph Loop Status - Iteration 1

## Current Status: BLOCKED

### Issue
The task requires running tests in a dev container:
- Command: `docker exec -it sagaapi-devcontainer-app-1 bash -c "cd /workspace && pytest"`
- Current environment: Docker is not available (`docker: command not found`)

### What I Found

**Existing Code:**
- `src/services/auth_service.py` - Minimal AuthService with placeholder authentication
- `src/repositories/auth_repository.py` - Basic AuthRepository with fake token
- No existing tests directory or test files

**Project Structure:**
```
SagaApi/
├── src/
│   ├── services/auth_service.py (9 lines, placeholder)
│   ├── repositories/auth_repository.py (9 lines, placeholder)
│   └── ... (other modules)
├── tests/ (doesn't exist yet)
└── ralph-tasks/ (documentation)
```

### What Needs to Happen

For this task to complete properly, one of these approaches is needed:

**Option A: User Runs This Locally**
The user should run `claude` CLI from their local machine where:
- Docker Desktop is installed and running
- Dev container is started: `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d`
- Then Ralph Loop can execute the task as specified

**Option B: Adapt the Task**
Modify the task to work without Docker:
- Install dependencies directly
- Run pytest without container
- Adjust the workflow accordingly

### Recommendation

This Ralph Loop session should be **run from the user's local machine** where Docker is available, not in a cloud/hosted Claude environment.

The task explicitly states:
- "Run all Python/testing commands in the dev container using `docker exec`"
- "Dev container: `sagaapi-devcontainer-app-1`"

Without Docker access, I cannot fulfill the task requirements.

## Next Steps

**For the User:**
1. Run `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d` locally
2. Verify container is running: `docker ps | grep sagaapi`
3. Start Claude CLI from local machine (not cloud)
4. Run `/ralph-loop` again with the same task

**If Docker Cannot Be Used:**
1. Modify `ralph-tasks/PROMPT.md` to remove container requirements
2. Update workflow to run pytest directly on host
3. Re-run Ralph Loop with updated task
