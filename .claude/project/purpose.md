# Project Purpose

This project is a website and API for a non-profit golf organization.

The organization’s goals:
- Manage users, events, donations, and participation
- Provide a reliable, easy-to-use experience
- Keep costs low and maintenance simple
- Protect donor and member data

Primary users:
- Golf participants
- Donors
- Organization administrators

This is not a high-frequency or high-scale system.
Correctness, clarity, and reliability matter more than extreme performance.

Always optimize for:
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Clear data ownership
